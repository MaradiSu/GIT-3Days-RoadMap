# Day 1 Exercises

In this section, you will practice the basic Git commands introduced in Day 1. Follow the instructions for each exercise.

## Exercise 1: Initializing a Repository

1. Create a new directory on your local machine called "my-project".
2. Navigate into the "my-project" directory.
3. Initialize a new Git repository in the "my-project" directory.
4. Verify that the repository has been successfully initialized.

## Exercise 2: Making Commits

1. Create a new file called "index.html" inside the "my-project" directory.
2. Add some HTML content to the "index.html" file.
3. Stage the "index.html" file for commit.
4. Commit the changes with a meaningful commit message.
5. Verify that the commit has been recorded successfully.

## Exercise 3: Checking Repository Status

1. Create a new file called "style.css" inside the "my-project" directory.
2. Open the "style.css" file in a text editor and make some changes.
3. Check the status of the repository.
4. Stage the changes made to the "style.css" file.
5. Verify the staged changes using the `git diff` command.
6. Commit the changes with an appropriate commit message.
7. Check the repository status again to ensure a clean working directory.

## Exercise 4: Viewing Repository History

1. Use the `git log` command to view the commit history of the repository.
2. Explore the various information displayed in the log, such as commit hash, author, date, and commit message.
3. Experiment with different options and flags to customize the log output.

## Exercise 5: Ignoring Files

1. Create a new file called "secret.txt" inside the "my-project" directory.
2. Add some confidential information to the "secret.txt" file.
3. Create a `.gitignore` file in the "my-project" directory.
4. Edit the `.gitignore` file and add a rule to ignore the "secret.txt" file.
5. Verify that the "secret.txt" file is now ignored by Git.

Complete these exercises to reinforce your understanding of the basic Git commands. Once you have completed all the exercises, you can proceed to Day 2.
